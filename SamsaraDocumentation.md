<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2" data-line-end="3">Samsara is a hand-illustrated escape room graphic adventure designed and developed by Joel de Palau. The main character has to enter the old Czarnecki’s residence and follow the clues scattered around each corner of the room to find out a turbulent history behind the walls. Dr. Yakob, a popular psychiatrist, will discover that his fate is conditioned by the karma, for the sins he committed in past life.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="4" data-line-end="5">This project is the result of a fictional history which focus on the concept “samsara” as the cycle of death and renaissance, according to Hindu culture, which argues that the future of the person is conditioned by the actions they perform during their lifetime: karma. Once they die, the reincarnate subject inherits the karma from the previous life. This process iterates until reaching the Mokxa.</p>

<h2 class="code-line" data-line-start=37 data-line-end=38><a id="Genre_37"></a>Genre</h2>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="38" data-line-end="39">Samsara can be considered a graphic adventure, as it’s not based on reflexes that the user must demonstrate, challenges, multiplayer mode, nor does real time exists. In addition, the player must resolve puzzles to follow the background story, as well as interact with the objects and investigate space. We can also label Samsara as escape room, because the player must use the objects present in the room to track the tracks so that they can enter and leave the interior of the house where the protagonist is located. Typically these video games replicate dungeons, prison cells, abandoned buildings, etc. In the case of Samsara, the protagonist is within the house of the Czarnecki family.</p>
<h2 class="code-line" data-line-start=40 data-line-end=41><a id="Target_audience_40"></a>Target audience</h2>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="41" data-line-end="42">Samsara is oriented by a broad but concrete audience. It doesn’t change much of the other graphic adventures and escape rooms. The requirements or features of the ideal user profile for Samsara are as following ones:</p>
<ul>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="42" data-line-end="43">The player must be patient and methodical, as observation and concentration are required to follow the steps and complete the game.</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="43" data-line-end="44">It’s preferable for the player to have experience playing both point-and-click and escape rooms graphic adventures.</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="44" data-line-end="45">It’s a plus if they value art and aesthetics as well as history.</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="45" data-line-end="47">It doesn’t matter either gender or social, psycho-physical or economic condition.</li>
</ul>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="47" data-line-end="48">According to the European PEGI rating system, Samsara contains:</p>
<ul>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="48" data-line-end="49">Violence as there are blood images, white weapons and dialogues hinting at violence.</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="49" data-line-end="50">Fear, as it can contain frightening images.</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="50" data-line-end="52">Discrimination, as Mstislav is discriminated against for suffering from a syndrome.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="code-line" data-line-start=52 data-line-end=53><a id="Inspiration_52"></a>Inspiration</h2>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="53" data-line-end="54">As seen before, the concept of samsara is the repetitive cycle of death and rebirth of a soul. In other words, it’s the way our soul or individual goes through different lives and states. The goal of this repetitive process is that the soul can end the cycle and reach the Mokxa (or Nirvana, according to Buddhism), i.e. liberation. The actions committed during these lives are called the karma. These influence the fate of the soul, determining whether the soul will be reincarnated – although the individual has committed actions that it should be – or will reach the end of the cycle, at last, freed. This concept has helped to draft the account on which Samsara is based.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="56" data-line-end="58">##Space and time<br>
The game takes place in a warm spring of 1972 in the old house of the Czarnecki, in a fictional rural village set in the European-Slavic aesthetics of the time. The story, however, dates back to the early 20th century, in the same residence. The player at no time strictly perceives a temporary change. However, through the cards he encounters on stage, they will be able to know what the house owners hide. These cards are not required to overcome the game, but to understand and put themselves in the skin of the protagonists.</p>
<h2 class="code-line" data-line-start=60 data-line-end=61><a id="Characters_60"></a>Characters</h2>
<h3 class="code-line" data-line-start=61 data-line-end=62><a id="Dr_Yakob_61"></a>Dr. Yakob</h3>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="62" data-line-end="63">Born in 1908, Yakob Paderewski is a recently retired psychiatrist and recognized among neighbours for treating and helping dozens of patients with very diverse disorders. Among these, there are numerous victims involved in cases that had been so devastating to the village. His career has been successful, but he would never have thought he would have to deal with a case like this, which, on the one hand, would call his vocation into question and, on the other, popularity would also be compromised. Yakob is the first-person protagonist of Samsara.</p>
<h3 class="code-line" data-line-start=64 data-line-end=65><a id="Rama_64"></a>Rama</h3>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="66" data-line-end="67">Rama was born in 1920 to Asha Czarnecki and Franz Schwarz. He studied political science and philosophy at the University of K.nigsberg in East Prussia. On his own, however, he has been studying Buddhist religion and thought, so he has kept his maternal roots alive. Rama is the only character to appear physically in the video game, being able to interact with him when he asks for it. He personally arranges for Yakob to find his fate, as Asha pleads with the karma to fall on him.</p>
<h3 class="code-line" data-line-start=68 data-line-end=69><a id="Asha_68"></a>Asha</h3>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="69" data-line-end="70">Born in Warsaw in 1882, the daughter of parents of Hindu origin, Asha grew up in a rural village near the capital. In 1898 he married Dvorák and in 1902 Mstislav was born. Years after his murder, in 1908 Dvorák left home, leaving Asha in charge of the house and expenses. Years later, Asha remade her life accompanied by a German journalist. He ends up taking him to a psychiatrist after having starred in several crisis episodes. This is the young Dr. Yakob.</p>
<h3 class="code-line" data-line-start=71 data-line-end=72><a id="Dvork_Czarnecki_71"></a>Dvorák Czarnecki</h3>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="72" data-line-end="73">Dvorák was born in 1872 in a village near Warsaw and raised in an orphanage after his parents Yuri and Brana died of a terminal illness when he was four years old. At 16, he became independent and went to the village to work as a shoemaker. A few years later, he met Asha, with whom he married in 1898. In 1902 they had a son, Mstislav, who was born with a syndrome at that unknown time: cri du chat4. That’s why he kills her. A few years later, in 1908, he began to receive anonymous death threats, which will frighten him and cause him to return to the house where he was born. There, however, there is a cat colony, which makes him think with Mstislav. He took his life the same year.</p>
<h3 class="code-line" data-line-start=74 data-line-end=75><a id="Mstislav_Czarnecki_74"></a>Mstislav Czarnecki</h3>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="75" data-line-end="76">He was born in 1902 with the Cri du chat syndrome. Within a few days of his life he is murdered by his father. His death will be the trigger for the whole of Samsara’s history and the fate of Yakob.</p>
<h3 class="code-line" data-line-start=77 data-line-end=78><a id="Yuri_and_Brana_77"></a>Yuri and Brana</h3>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="78" data-line-end="79">Dvorák’s parents lived in handicrafts. Brana was a concocter and modist, while Yuri had a family business that for decades designed and sewn the shoes of the village’s neighbors. The couple died of typhus four years after having Dvorák. They are the founders of the Czarnecki residence in 1872.</p>
<h2 class="code-line" data-line-start=80 data-line-end=81><a id="Story_80"></a>Story</h2>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="81" data-line-end="82">In 1972, the popular Dr. Yakob received a letter from Asha’s son, Rama, notifying him of the death of his mother and thanking him for years of monitoring and treatment. The letter also states that life is a cycle, “everything you give, you will end up receiving” (reference to samsara). With this, Yakob decides to investigate further what would have been one of the worst murders the village would ever have witnessed.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="83" data-line-end="84">As the Czarnecki receiver enters and inspects, Yakob reveals clues that this is the reincarnation of Dvorák himself and for the karmes committed he will have to pay for the consequences, as Asha suggests. Below is graphically represented the timeline of the story, to have a more approximate and visible idea, where the lives of Dvorák, Asha, Mstislav and Yakob are contrasted.</p>
